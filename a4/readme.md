# CSCI 571 – Assignment 4 (Android Client Application)

## Overview
This project is the Android version of Assignment 3, extending the same backend architecture to a native mobile platform. The application was built using **Kotlin** and **Material 3**, consuming the same **Node.js + Express** backend APIs as the web client to deliver equivalent functionality on Android.

## What I Built
- Developed a **native Android application** using **Kotlin**
- Designed UI components using **Material 3** following modern Android design guidelines
- Integrated the app with an existing **Node.js + Express REST API**
- Implemented **network requests, JSON parsing, and UI state management**
- Ensured feature parity with the web version (search, data display, navigation flows)

## Tech Stack
- **Platform:** Android
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Material 3
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (shared with Assignment 3)

## Key Features
- Native Android UI with Material 3 components
- Asynchronous API calls with structured response handling
- Clean separation between UI, networking, and data layers
- Reuse of backend services across platforms

## Running Locally
1. Start the backend server (same as Assignment 3)
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**
3. Build and run on an emulator or physical Android device

## Notes
This project focuses on **client-side Android development and backend integration**. It was not deployed to an app store or hosted publicly, and is intended to demonstrate native mobile development and cross-platform backend reuse.
